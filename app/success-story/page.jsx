            She is a middle-class girl with a lot of dreams. She wanted
            to be a good job holder, but later due to marriage she
            stopped working. Still, she was passionate — she wanted to
            do something meaningful in life.
          </p>

          <p>
            That desire slowly transformed her into a successful
            entrepreneur today, known as{" "}
            <b>Sridevi Homemade Herbal Products</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            She believes every woman dreams of being beautiful. Beauty
            is something many women invest a large part of their life
            in. Her friends and family often told her they had tried
            many creams, face washes, ointments and chemical products,
            yet they were never truly satisfied.
          </p>

          <p>
            In her opinion, beauty is a long-term journey. It cannot
            happen overnight or within a week. Daily habits like
            drinking enough water, eating healthy food, and using
            natural products lead to true, lasting beauty.

            The Turning Point
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Once, she met a leading and experienced beautician who
            shared a powerful truth — many people today prefer harsh
            chemicals for instant glow. These products may give quick
            results, but they drastically reduce skin quality over
            time, making skin age faster than one’s actual age.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            Those words influenced her deeply. From that day onward,
            she decided to completely avoid chemical-based products.

            Journey into Ayurveda & Nature
          </h2>

          <p>
            She began researching natural ways to maintain beauty.
            With guidance from her friend’s brother, a leading
            Ayurvedic doctor in town, she learned that nature has
            countless valuable herbs that keep us healthy and
            beautiful.

          <p>
            People call traditional methods “old model”, but they
            forget one truth — <b>Old is Gold</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Later, she met an experienced woman with over 15 years of
            expertise in herbal product preparation. This mentor
            trained her, encouraged her, and helped her gain
            confidence in her formulations.

            She started preparing bath powder for her own use. Slowly,
            her family and friends noticed visible skin improvements.
            Friends began asking for the bath powder again and again.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
            Later, she invented a herbal hair pack powder which
